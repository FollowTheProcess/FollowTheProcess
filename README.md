## Bio

*Materials & Process Engineer turned python programmer! :nerd_face:*

I'm Tom, a materials engineer for a small UK company. On a day to day basis I melt, bend, break, blow up, cut up, look at, and measure metal things.

Recently, thanks to the end of the world, when I'm not doing that I try my hand at Python programming and Data Science.
