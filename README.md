## Bio

*Materials & Process Engineer turned python programmer! :nerd_face:*

Old enough to remember these -> :vhs:, but too young to remember these -> :fax:

I'm Tom, a materials engineer in the UK. On a day to day basis I melt, bend, break, blow up, cut up, look at, and measure metal things :microscope:

Recently I'm trying my hand at Python programming and Data Science :bar_chart:
